### <a name="testimonials"></a>Testimonials

> **Kara is one of those unicorn people who can just handle whatever situation you present her with. She started at the shop as a volunteer, based on her Wordpress background, and is now our director of operations; she recently solved our unsolvable profit margin problem. She is basically magical and I would recommend her for any job; I paid her (over her vociferous protests) out of my own pocket when the shop was cash-strapped and I would do it again in a heartbeat. Her work is invaluable and her demeanor, presence, and general vibe are really just priceless; she has the ability to be ruthlessly practical and steadfastly optimistic at the same time. She also has unimpeachable ethics and a gift of moral insight and clarity that is truly rare.**
